## Features

- 📈 **Weight & Calorie Logging**: Fast entry for daily bodyweight and calories eaten.
- 🔥 **Dynamic Maintenance Calculator**: Get a personalized estimate of your maintenance calories based on your own logged data, not generic formulas (although if you have no data and want to get going with your goal, there's a TDEE calculator too).
- 🎯 **Goal Tracking**: Set custom goals—cut, bulk, or maintain—by date, rate, or target weight.
- 🗓️ **Trends & Analytics**: Visualize progress with trend lines, goal lines, and month-by-month breakdowns (more charting options coming soon).
- 🔁 **Health Connect Sync**: Import/export weight data with Health Connect.
- ⚙️ **Customizable Settings**: Choose kg/lbs and configure your tracking preferences.
- 🔒 **100% Local, 100% Private**: All data stays on your device unless you export it. I really don't want your data.
